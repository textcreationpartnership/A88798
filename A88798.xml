            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have thought it fitting to give you ſome adviſe concerning the deſign and the uſe of this Book, whereof I am the Author, without vanity. My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is not to diſpleaſe or offend any body, though I doe not doubt, but that ſome ill-willers, or ſome envious, will ſpeak of it at randome; but my intention is to ſerve and ſuccour them who ſhall ſtand in need of it, whereof many having not the experience, and the memory in readineſs, will not, or dare not preſume to learne what they know not, partly through pride, and partly alſo through ſome other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Some do beleeve that they wrong themſelves, in taking counſel concerning that thing, which, belike, they ought to be skilfull in. Some others having no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with thoſe who could teach them, are aſhamed to preſent themſelves without a reward, which their want can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give them leave to reach to. Therfore becauſe I love dearly them of my calling, I have eſteemed it of my duty to impart
<pb facs="tcp:111078:9"/>
unto them that little which I doe know, &amp; ſo to deliver them out of this trouble.</p>
            <p>As for the uſe, I have made you up four ſervices; before each of them, you will find the Table, and then the diſcourſe following after; and have divided them according to the ſeveral faſhions of the meals uſed in Fleſh dayes Fiſh dayes, and Lent, and ſpecially Good-friday. I have added many other generall things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you have the tables and diſcourſes. I have intermixed the Table and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Paſtry works according to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and other ſmall houſhold curioſities, uſefull for all ſorts of perſons. If you find ſome Articles in the Tables, which be not in the diſcourſe, blame me not, I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them becauſe they are common, and I have put them in the Tables to put one in mind of them. Laſtly, for a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, dear Reader, I do ask you nothing elſe, but that my labour may be profitable and agreeable to you.</p>

There hath been many Bookes, and which have been well accepted of, as the charitable Phyſician and others, for remedies and the healing of ſickneſſes with little coſt, and without the uſe of Apothecaries But this booke which tends onely to the preſerving and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of health in a true and conſtant courſe, in teaching how to correct the vitious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of meates by contrary and ſeverall ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; the ſcope whereof, I ſay, is only to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford unto man a ſolid nouriſhment, well dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and conformable to his appetites, which are in many the rule of their life, and of their <hi>(en bon point)</hi> looking well, ought, as I think, to be of no leſſe conſideration, ſince that it is ſweeter by farre to make according, to one's abilitie an honeſt and reaſonable expenſe in ſauces, and other delicacies of meates, for to cauſe the life and health to ſubſiſt, then to ſpend vaſt ſummes of money in drugs, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinall
<pb facs="tcp:111078:10"/>
hearbs, potions, and other troubleſome remedies for the recovering of health. This hath perſwaded me, after many ſollicitations of my friends, to let it ſee the light, and to ſet it forth in this great City, which makes profit of all, rejects nothing, and where what is not fit for one, is uſefull for another. It's author hath told you in his word of adviſe what uſe and profit it may bring; And I dare boldly enhanſe it, and ſay, that it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſefull, but alſo neceſſarie, becauſe that he doth not onely ſet out the fineſt and the daintieſt faſhions of making ready meates, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie works, and other things which are ſerved upon great mens tables, but he gives you alſo the precepts of the moſt common and moſt ordinarie things, which are uſed in the food of houſeholds, which doe onely make a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and moderate expenſe, and in the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready of which, many doe amiſſe in the too much or too little; He doth teach you the faſhions of a thouſand kinds of hearbs (and legumes) and other victuals, which are found plentifully in the country, where the moſt part are ignorant of the meanes of making them ready with credit and contentment: and thus it is cleere, that with great reaſon I have done this good ſervice to the publick, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for daintineſſe, but alſo for neceſſities ſake: Conſidered alſo, that France carrying it above all other Nations in the world in point of civility, courteſie, and comelineſs in every
<pb facs="tcp:111078:10"/>
kind of converſation, is not leſſe eſteemed, becauſe of it's comely and daintie faſhion of feeding. And the City of <hi>Paris</hi> carrying it farre above all the other Provinces, as the Metropolitan head City, and the ſeat of our Kings, doubtleſs her inferiours will in this follow the eſteeme that ſhe will make of it. And I hope, that ſince that I doe give her the firſt fruits of it, ſhe will accept of them kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and others will imitate her: After which other Nations may very well be ſtirred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to conforme themſelves to her, who as ſhe doth excell in all what belongeth to life, cannot be ignorant of the meanes how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it contented and peaceable, by the uſe of the things which doe maintaine it, and cauſe it to ſubſiſt. I may aſſure you that for my part I have had a moſt ſpeciall care to ſet it in its luſter, and to enrich a little its mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which perhaps will ſeeme to ſome Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, to be leſſe worthy of precepts; but the moſt judicious will judge otherwiſe, and will conſider, that all the books both ancient and moderne, being for the moſt part for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the ſpirit: There was a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the body, without the good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of which it cannot act, ſhould have a ſhare in it, &amp; ſpecially in a thing ſo neceſſary for its conſervation. Enjoy it, Courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whileſt I will ſtudy how to put forth to ſale ſomething which will deſerve your more elevated and more ſolid occupations.</p>

                     <hi>13.</hi> Inſtruction how to make the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry work for Fiſh.</head>
                  <p>THe puft paſte is made thus. Take four pounds of flowre, allayed with ſalt and water, very ſweet nevertheleſs; after it is a little reſted, ſpread it with the quantity of two pounds of butter, joyn them together, and leave a third part of your paſte empty,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:111078:120"/>
for to fold it up into three, and when your butter is ſhut up, ſpread your paſte again very ſquare, for to fold it up four-fold; after this, turn it up thus, other three turnes, and ſet it in a coole place, for to uſe it upon occaſion. And then ſpread your paſte proportionably to the pie or tourte which you have a mind to make up; and obſerve that this paſte is harder to be fed than any other.</p>
                  <p>The fine paſte is made up with four pounds of flowre, and one pound and a half of butter, which you muſt allay very well together with ſalt, after this, let it reſt untill you have uſe for it, and make with it pies or tourtes.</p>
                  <p>The paſte with warm water is made the ſame way, but you warm the water and the butter; after it is made, let it reſt more than the other, and handle it but a very little, leſt it burn, make pie or tourte with it.</p>
                  <p>The brown paſte is made with flowre of Rye, with water and a little butter; you may put to it, if you will, ſome ſalt and peper; when it is very ſtrong and reſted, make veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon paſties with it.</p>
                  <p>All kind of pies, fat or lean, which are eaten warme, are ſeaſoned the ſelf ſame way, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meat. You may put in it the ſame garniſh of garden, as muſhrums, troufles, ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragus, yolks of eggs, bottoms of artichocks, capers, cardes, piſtaches.</p>
                  <p>For the fleſh pies, beſides the garniſh of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:111078:120"/>
garden, you may put in them ſweetbreads, ſtones, combes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fleſh pies garniſhed, and of meat very tender, will not endure the oven above two houres and a half; they of fiſh big or ſmall, of the ſame ſize, as long.</p>
                  <p>The pie of young hare will not be in the oven above two houres, be it in puft paſte or other; it is ſerved warm and uncovered.</p>
                  <p>The pies which you will keep, muſt be of a deeper taſte or haut gouſt than thoſe which you make for to eat warm; if you carry them farre, the paſte muſt be ſomwhat brown, and if it be fine, you muſt get a basket made for the purpoſe for to carrie them in.</p>
                  <p>You muſt lard your leane pies with Eele or Carp, well ſeaſoned with peper, ſalt, vinegar, and beaten cloves; make your paſte fine, or otherwiſe, and ſeaſon your pie with cloves, ſalt, peper, fine herbs, and a <hi>chalotte;</hi> when it is made up, endore it, in the fleſh days, with the yolk of an egge; in Lent, with egs of pike allayed with water, and put it in the oven, and a while after give it vent.</p>

            <p>FRiends, doe not thinke that theſe brief Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were drawn out of thoſe Texts of Scripture quoted after them. For the Sayings were written ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any quotations were made.

            <p>As for my own Sentences, they have little or nothing in them that I have begg'd, or borrowed. Nay I fear, it will be ſaid, that they have too much of my ſelfe in them. But though they are like the

            <p>They are moſt of them common Notions, but never the worſe for that: For the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Day,</hi> the <hi>Ayre,</hi> the <hi>Fire,</hi> the <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> &amp; the <hi>Goſpel</hi> are not the worſe for being common, but the better. <hi>Boni proprium eſt eſſe commune.</hi> 'Tis proper to that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is good to be common: And that which does good to many, is more excellent

and more divine then that, that does good to one only.</p>
            <p>They are Trilineals, or three lines a piece (moſt of them) and ſo more porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the memorie. Not being ſome of them 2. lines, and ſome halfe a page.</p>
            <p>They are Pentad's, or juſt five in a page: ſo that a man, though ſtreightned in Time, notwithſtanding may read to a Period preſently, and carry a <hi>Theam to thinke on</hi> with him, as an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt worſe thoughts.</p>
